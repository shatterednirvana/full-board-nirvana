full-board-nirvana
==================

A set of tools to help you get better at chess visualization.

At the moment, it's only got support for a single exercise, inspired by Daniel Rensch's excellent video "Full Board Awareness". It picks a random square on the chess board and asks you if it's white or black. It does this a configurable number of times (defaulting to 25), and reports how many you got right at the end.

TODO
==================
- Better input validation if the user types an unrecognized answer
- Other exercises!
